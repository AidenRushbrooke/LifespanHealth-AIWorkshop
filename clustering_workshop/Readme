# LifespanHealth-AIWorkshop: AI-Driven Symptom Clustering

Welcome to the Lifespan Health AI Workshop! This repository contains everything you need to complete the **symptom clustering workshop** using synthetic Long Covid data and unsupervised machine learning.

## What You'll Be Doing

You’ll be working with one of five **synthetic datasets**, each simulating self-reported Long Covid symptoms. Your goal is to:

1. **Explore the data** using dimensionality reduction (UMAP)
2. **Identify symptom clusters** using unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN)
3. **Interpret the clinical relevance** of your findings

Don’t worry if you’ve never used Python before — this guide will walk you through every step.
