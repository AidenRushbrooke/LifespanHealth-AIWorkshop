# LifespanHealth-AIWorkshop: AI-Driven Symptom Clustering

Welcome to the Lifespan Health AI Workshop! This repository contains everything you need to complete the **symptom clustering workshop** using synthetic Long Covid data and unsupervised machine learning.

## What You'll Be Doing

You‚Äôll be working with one of five **synthetic datasets**, each simulating self-reported Long Covid symptoms. Your goal is to:

1. **Explore the data** using dimensionality reduction (UMAP)
2. **Identify symptom clusters** using unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN)
3. **Interpret the clinical relevance** of your findings

Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôve never used Python before ‚Äî this guide will walk you through every step.

## What to do before the workshop

## 1. Installing Python (for Beginners)

If you don‚Äôt already have Python installed:

1. Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click ‚ÄúDownload Python 3.12.x‚Äù (or latest version).
3. Run the installer.
4. **IMPORTANT**: During installation, tick the box that says **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** before clicking "Install Now".

Once Python is installed, open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn umap-learn hdbscan matplotlib seaborn
```

This installs all the Python packages you‚Äôll need for this project.

### 1: Download an IDE 
For an easier coding experience, we recommend using **PyCharm**, a free and user-friendly Python IDE.

### Download PyCharm Community Edition

You can download it here:

üëâ [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

Choose **Community Edition** (free) unless you already have access to the Professional version.

### Installation Instructions

1. Download the installer from the link above.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. When prompted, make sure to:
   - ‚úÖ Add launcher to Desktop
   - ‚úÖ Add Python to system PATH (if not already done)
4. Once installed, open PyCharm and create a new project or open this folder as a project.
5. Open `cluster_analysis_full.py` and click the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è run button to get started!

üí° PyCharm also includes a built-in terminal and Python package manager, making it easy to install anything you need.
