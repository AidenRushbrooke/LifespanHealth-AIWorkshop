Welcome to the workshop on applying simple AI methods for dementia research using the Orange Data Mining tool!

## About Orange Data Mining
[Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) is an open-source data visualization, machine learning, and data mining toolkit. It features a visual programming front-end for explorative data analysis and interactive visualization, and can also be used as a Python library. Orange is designed to be user-friendly, making complex data analysis tasks accessible to everyone.

## Workshop Materials
All materials are located within this `orange_workshop` directory.
 
* **Example Workflows:** Pre-built Orange workflow files (`.ows`) are stored in `examples/`.
* **Synthetic Datasets:** The synthetic data files (`.csv`) for use in the workflows are stored in `examples/data/`.

## Synthetic Datasets
The datasets provided are **synthetically generated**. They are designed to mimic the statistical properties and trends found in real samples but **do not contain any real patient information**. These datasets are for example workshop purposes only.

We have provided datasets with two different feature sets and two different sample sizes (5k/20k):
1.  **MRI Features:** These datasets contain features typically derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
2.  **Cognitive Scores:** These datasets contain features representing scores from various cognitive tests.

## Example Workflows
1.  **`classification_simple.ows`:**
    * Demonstrates a basic classification pipeline: loading data, selecting features, training a simple model, and evaluating its performance (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
2.  **`classification_workflow_extended.ows`:**
    * Expands on the simple classification by introducing more advanced techniques for feature importance evaluations. 
3.  **`visualise.ows`:**
    * Focuses on data exploration and visualization.

## Getting Started
1.  **Install Orange:** If you haven't already, download and install Orange from [https://orangedatamining.com/download/](https://orangedatamining.com/download/).
2.  **Explore Workflows:** Open the example workflows in Orange and experiment with the different widgets and datasets.
3.  **Thats it - super simple!**

We hope you find these examples informative and enjoy exploring the capabilities of Orange!
