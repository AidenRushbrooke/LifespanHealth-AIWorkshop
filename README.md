# 3) Workshop: Simple AI Methods for Dementia Research using Orange

Welcome to the workshop on applying simple AI methods for dementia research using the Orange Data Mining tool!

This workshop will guide you through loading data, building machine learning models, and visualizing results in Orange, all without needing to write code. We will be using synthetically generated datasets that mimic real-world clinical data.

## About Orange Data Mining

[Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) is an open-source data visualization, machine learning, and data mining toolkit. It features a visual programming front-end for explorative data analysis and interactive visualization, and can also be used as a Python library. Orange is designed to be user-friendly, making complex data analysis tasks accessible to everyone.

**Key Features of Orange:**
* **Visual Programming:** Drag-and-drop widgets to create data analysis workflows.
* **Interactive Data Exploration:** Easily visualize your data and discover patterns.
* **Comprehensive Toolkit:** Includes a wide range of tools for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
* **No Coding Required (mostly):** Perform powerful AI/ML tasks without writing extensive code.
* **Extensible:** Can be extended with add-ons for more specialized analyses.

## Workshop Materials

All materials for this workshop are located within the `orange_workshop` directory.

* **Slides:** The main presentation slides for this workshop (`Simple_AI_Methods_for_Demetia_slides.pptx`) are located directly in the `orange_workshop/` folder.
